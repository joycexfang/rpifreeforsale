# RPI Free & For Sale

## Group
Joyce Fang, Yuchen Luo, and Ilhwan Song

## Problem
Current administrators of the RPI Free & For Sale Facebook Group are not allowing access to RPI students. This new website will enable RPI students to buy and sell items more easily and efficiently among other RPI students.

## What it does: 
A simple and easy website that helps RPI students exchange items for free and/or buy and sell items. It contains a listing of items that are for sale, an “upload” feature to post an item, and the descriptions of those items. Additionally, potential buyers can get in contact with the seller by submitting a “Contact the Seller” form.

## Who it serves: 
Any RPI student who wishes to buy or sell items. In order for students to post an item on the website, the student must currently be enrolled in RPI. Therefore, in the process of posting an item, the student must confirm their RPI email by typing their email on the website and receiving a confirmation code through their RPI email.

## In Context of Existing Applications: 
Websites such as Craigslist and Amazon are fairly similar to how our website functions. Craigslist has a “create a posting” button which will be like the upload feature on our website. Amazon has listings of products, which is what we hope to achieve with the layout and design of the items for sale. However, the difference of our website from Craigslist or Amazon is that RPI Free and For Sale is meant to serve only RPI students. Our project distinguishes itself from other projects because we think about the safety of the users first. Making sure that all the users are RPI students and making the users submit the confirmation code are essential to our project. RPI Facebook group Free and For Sale exists; however, it is no longer in functions.
